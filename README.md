StressSense

Introduction:
Stress is a common issue that affects mental and physical health. This project aims to detect stress levels using a machine learning-based Decision Tree Classifier. The system predicts stress levels (low, medium, high, or very high) based on physiological data like heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, and sleeping habits. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows users to input their data and visualize results.

Features:
1.Stress Level Prediction:
Detects stress levels based on user inputs like heart rate, snoring rate, and more.
2.Data Visualization:
Displays interactive charts to analyze feature importance and dataset trends.
3.User-Friendly Interface:
Built with Streamlit for easy input and stress level prediction.
4.Accuracy Assurance:
Uses a Decision Tree Classifier with a measurable accuracy score.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Libraries Used:
scikit-learn: For training and testing the model.
pandas: For dataset manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
Streamlit: For building the user interface.


Workflow:
1.Data Input: Users provide physiological data through a web interface.
2.Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed for training the Decision Tree Classifier.
3.Model Training: The classifier is trained on physiological data to predict stress levels.
4.Prediction: User inputs are passed through the trained model to predict stress levels.
5.Visualization: Insights such as feature distributions and stress level trends are displayed.
